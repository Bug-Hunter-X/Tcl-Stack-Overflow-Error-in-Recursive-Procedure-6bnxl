# Tcl Stack Overflow Bug

This repository contains a simple Tcl program that demonstrates a stack overflow error due to uncontrolled recursion.  The `bug.tcl` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.tcl` offers a corrected version.  The error highlights the importance of proper base cases and iterative approaches to avoid stack overflow issues, particularly when dealing with deeply recursive functions.

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Execute `tclsh bug.tcl` to observe the stack overflow error.
4. Execute `tclsh bugSolution.tcl` to see the corrected version in action.
